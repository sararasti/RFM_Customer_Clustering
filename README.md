# Basket Analysis Chart Visualization in Power BI
At the top of the dashboard, you'll find two filter options that allow you to select and apply filters to the other charts for a more focused analysis of specific baskets.
## Basket Analysis Network Chart:
 ‚Ä¢ The Basket Analysis Network Chart is a powerful tool for visualizing the relationships between items in your data.
 ‚Ä¢ This chart takes the form of a traditional Scatter chart, making it easy to spot trends and correlations.
## Understanding the Data:
 ‚Ä¢ It's important to note that when a product has connections with multiple other products, the number displayed is the sum of the lift for those various connections. While this number itself may seem meaningless, a higher value indicates that the product has significant Lift (relationships) with other products. This, in turn, suggests that the product warrants further analysis.
## Basket Analysis Map:
 ‚Ä¢ The Basket Analysis Map is a valuable feature that allows you to visualize the relationship between lift, support, and confidence in the baskets.
 ‚Ä¢ When you hover your mouse over a bubble, you can see not only the confidence but also the lift and support values, providing deeper insights into your data.
## Utilizing the Chart:
 ‚Ä¢ This chart serves as a powerful tool for analyzing your product sales and uncovering cross-selling opportunities.
 ‚Ä¢ By examining the relationships and correlations within your data, you can make data-driven decisions to boost your business's performance.
